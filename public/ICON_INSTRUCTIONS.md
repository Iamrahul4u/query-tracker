# PWA Icon Instructions

You need to create two icon files for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
   - Used for mobile home screen
   - Should be a square PNG with your app logo
   - Recommended: Blue background (#1a73e8) with white icon

2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)
   - Used for splash screen and larger displays
   - Should be a square PNG with your app logo
   - Same design as 192px version, just larger

## Optional (for better app store listing):

3. **screenshot-mobile.png** (540x720 pixels)
   - Screenshot of your app on mobile
   - Shows users what the app looks like

4. **screenshot-desktop.png** (1280x720 pixels)
   - Screenshot of your app on desktop
   - Shows users what the app looks like

## How to Create:

### Option 1: Use an online tool

- Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Upload your logo
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Use design software

- Create in Figma/Photoshop/Canva
- Export as PNG at exact sizes
- Place in the `public/` folder

### Option 3: Simple placeholder (temporary)

- Use any square image
- Resize to 192x192 and 512x512
- Rename to icon-192.png and icon-512.png

## Current Status:

❌ icon-192.png - NOT FOUND
❌ icon-512.png - NOT FOUND
❌ screenshot-mobile.png - OPTIONAL
❌ screenshot-desktop.png - OPTIONAL

Place these files in the `public/` folder.
