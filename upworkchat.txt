Hello!



I'd like to invite you to take a look at the job I've posted. Please submit a proposal if you're available and interested.

Here is the updated proposal with the price adjusted to $230.



Subject: Simple AppSheet Lead Tracker (Gmail Integrated) for $230



Hi there,



I read your request for a "non-CRM" and I love the focus on simplicity. You are absolutely right to consider AppSheet—it is the perfect tool for this because it is native to Google Workspace and handles the SSO authentication automatically.



I can build this system for you using AppSheet connected to a structured Google Sheet. Here is how I will address your specific requirements:



Gmail Integration: I will configure the AppSheet Gmail add-on so your team can view and edit leads without leaving their inbox.



The "Junior vs. Senior" Logic: This is the most critical part. I will set up "Slices" and User Roles so that:



Juniors: See a "Claim" button to self-assign, but cannot change the assignee to others.



Seniors: Have a full dropdown to assign leads to any user email in the organization.



Data Retention: I will create a simple automation bot (or Google Apps Script) that runs nightly to archive or delete leads older than 30 days, keeping the system lightweight.



My Offer: I am currently focused on building my profile on Upwork, so I am looking for straightforward, high-quality projects like this to earn a 5-star review.



I am offering to build this complete system, including the user permission logic and Gmail setup, for a fixed price of $230.



I can have the initial prototype ready for you to test within 24 hours. I’m available to start immediately.



Best regards, Rahul Gupta

Hi Rahul. I am seriously considering you but can you provide some relevant details of any similar project you have done?



Also one clarification:
The senior users can see all new leads coming in, which when entered to the common pool are giving status bucket A ( which is for all new leads, unassigned yet) . This status bucket is not visible to junior users , while all remaining status buckets are also visible to junior users

Rahul Gupta
1:44 PM
Hi,
I’ve worked with Google Scripts and Google Sheets, but I haven’t used AppSheet yet. However, I expect it to be similar to other no-code tools I’ve used. I’ve worked with advanced no-code platforms like Bubble.io, FlutterFlow, and Zite to build apps.



I don't have any similar project with Appsheet but have one with sheets and google scripts.

Bubble: AI app development meets visual, no-code editing
Launch real apps without limits on an all-in-one platform that lets you switch seamlessly between AI prompting and a visual editor. No code required — ever.

The overall task is divided into two separate projects since both are independent of each other although there is some interconnection , therefore have given an understanding of the flow in a common document. You may propose your cost and timeline for either of the two projects and/or both. Thanks

Hi Rahul. So in the above FRD document, you may just read the portions highlighted in Blue + the portions not marked in colour ( which is common explanation) to understand and focus on the project we were discussing earlier, to be executed via appsheet. The portions highlighted in green ( Gmail X Salesforce integration for Lead creation) can be ignored by you and considered out of scope for yourself. The only reason i have made a common document is for understanding of the flow as both projects although independent, are some inter dependency. Understood?

Rahul Gupta
9:27 AM
Yes,I got it. I was looking at both and cross checking some things for second project.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
9:40 AM
Based on what you had proposed, the second project in green I guess is out of scope for you

RB
Raj Bhanushali
11:50 AM
Hey Rahul

R u there

Rahul Gupta
12:10 PM
Hi Raj,



Thanks for the detailed FRD! I've gone through it and have a few options for you.



🔷 Option A: Gmail Add-on Only — $250



I'll build a Gmail sidebar add-on using Google Apps Script. It will appear directly inside Gmail on both desktop and mobile.



What's included: • All 7 status buckets (A to G) • 3 user roles - Junior, Senior, Admin • Self-assign for juniors, assign-anyone for seniors • View by Bucket → then by User • 3-day filter for buckets E and G • Works on Gmail mobile app • Google Workspace login only (SSO)



What's NOT included: • View by User → then by Bucket • Saved preferences • "gm" indicator



Timeline: ~2 weeks



🔷 Option B: AppSheet + Gmail Plugin — $400



This gives you the best of both worlds.



AppSheet for: • Rich visual interface • All views and filters • Native mobile app



Gmail Add-on for: • Quick access button inside Gmail • Opens AppSheet without separate login



What's included: • Everything from Option A • Plus View by User → Bucket • Better mobile experience via AppSheet app



Timeline: ~2-3 weeks



Note: Requires Google Workspace with AppSheet access.



Quick question before we start:



The FRD says "Bucket A visible to all users" but earlier we discussed it should be visible to seniors only. Which one is correct?



Let me know which option works better for you, or if you'd like to discuss on a quick call!



Best, Rahul

Hi rahul

Rahul Gupta
12:18 PM
Hello

RB
Raj Bhanushali
12:18 PM
So basically this is for Project A only?

Rahul Gupta
12:18 PM
Yes

RB
Raj Bhanushali
12:19 PM
Which is your recommendation considering feature , view and user friendliness , UI UX are our priorities and should be doable from mobile app

Rahul Gupta
12:21 PM
Based on your priorities (UI/UX, mobile-friendly, all features), I recommend Option B at $400. AppSheet gives you a much better user experience on mobile with proper cards, filters, and a native app feel. The Gmail plugin will just be a shortcut to access it without switching tabs.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
1:19 PM
I pursued with you based on your quote of 230 usd for the same requirement. I have just detailed it out now which was the next step in any case

Rahul Gupta
1:33 PM
I can implement the AppSheet + Apps Script + Google Sheets solution as per my proposal for $230. However, if you require mobile integration along with a Gmail Add-on, that would mean building two separate applications for the same workflow (one for AppSheet/mobile and one Gmail Add-on for inside Gmail).

RB
Raj Bhanushali
1:36 PM
Mobile integration was mentioned in my requirement earlier also na

Rahul Gupta
1:37 PM
You're right, mobile was in the requirement. Let me clarify:



AppSheet itself works on mobile — it has its own mobile app that your team can install. So for $230, you'll get:



✅ AppSheet web app (desktop browser)
✅ AppSheet mobile app (Android/iOS)
✅ Google Sheets backend
✅ Google Workspace SSO
✅ All features from my original proposal



The $400 quote was for an additional Gmail Add-on if you specifically wanted the system to appear inside Gmail itself (as a sidebar), on top of the AppSheet app.



If AppSheet's mobile app is sufficient for mobile access, then $230 covers everything.



Does that work for you?

RB
Raj Bhanushali
1:39 PM
Advanced AppSheet features beyond Core may need a separate paid plan.



https://support.google.com/a/answer/10100275?hl=en



We have Google work space starter plan— which has appsheet access included but advanced appsheet features are necessary?

Manage AppSheet in your organization - Google Workspace Admin Help
AppSheet is available as an add-on paid subscription to all Google Workspace editions. AppSheet Core licenses are included at no cost with most Google Workspace editions. See Google Workspace editions
Rahul Gupta
1:41 PM
"Google Workspace Business Starter" includes AppSheet Core licenses for each domain-verified user at no additional cost.



I checked Google Workspace Business Starter plan. It already includes AppSheet Core at no extra cost.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
1:57 PM
I prefer it to appear inside gmail.. can u share a no regret cost for that

Rahul Gupta
2:01 PM
You removed this message

For $300, I'll build a custom Gmail Add-on with everything:



✅ Gmail sidebar integration (desktop + mobile)
✅ All 7 status buckets (A to G)
✅ 3 user roles (Junior, Senior, Admin)
✅ Role-based visibility rules
✅ Self-assign + assign to others
✅ Progressive status changes
✅ View Type I (Bucket → User)
✅ View Type II (User → Bucket)
✅ 3-day visibility filter for E/G
✅ 7-day expansion option
✅ Saved user preferences
✅ Query subgroups (New/Ongoing/SEO)
✅ "gm" indicator (manual toggle — user marks when Lead is entered in SF)
✅ Google Sheets backend
✅ Google Workspace SSO



No AppSheet required — pure Gmail Add-on + Google Sheets.



Timeline: 2-3 weeks



Does this work for you?

RB
Raj Bhanushali
2:04 PM
The option B was your recommended approach right

Rahul Gupta
2:05 PM
yes

Option B was my recommendation for best UI/UX on mobile.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
2:05 PM
And how is the UI/ UX on desktop with that? As desktop is largely used

Rahul Gupta
2:10 PM
On dashboard UI would be clean as we've more options with appsheet.

Another offer I can propose is: $250 for the Gmail Add-on only, and $100 for the AppSheet app, so both together would be $350.
In return, I would request that these be treated as two separate jobs/contracts, since that will help me receive separate reviews and improve visibility on my profile.In this way, you're first getting option A then if you want to proceed with option B as well it'll be additionally available to get.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
2:13 PM
So that means I will be actually getting Option B fully and paying 350 usd total?

Rahul Gupta
2:18 PM
Yes

RB
Raj Bhanushali
2:20 PM
Can u chat for 2 mins so we can close this

What would be the proposed start date and timeline to execute

Rahul Gupta
2:32 PM
Sure, i could start from tomorrow. And the option a will take me a week and another week for option b. You'll be able to test it in 3 days after the project starts. Post project deployment bugs fixes will be handled by me as well.

RB
Raj Bhanushali
2:33 PM
Post project issues and handholding for bugs or issues will be for how long?

I am principally ok to go ahead but need visibility of the last thing

mentioned above

Rahul Gupta
2:36 PM
Sure, it's for one month. Any issues or bugs faced in the project will be handled by me.

RB

Great. lets go ahead and sign off. Advise on the next steps. I am taking a break for lunch for 30 mins

Rahul Gupta

Option 1: Client Creates a Developer Account (Recommended)
Ask the client to:



Create a new Google Workspace user just for you: developer@theircompany.com
Grant it Admin access temporarily
You use this account for development
Client deletes or disables it after project completion

Option 2: Limited Admin Access
Client keeps their admin account, but:



Adds you as a Delegated Admin with limited permissions
Only grants access to: Apps Script, Gmail Add-on publishing, Google Sheets
Admin Console Path:



Admin Console → Users → Add User → Create developer account
OR
Admin Console → Admin Roles → Create custom role → Assign to your email

I have changed the terms in this proposal.

Raj Bhanushali sent an offer

8:07 PM
We are seeking a developer to create a minimal or no-code internal lead-tracking system integrated with Google Workspace (Gmail + SSO). This system is not a CRM and is intentionally simple and manual. The objective is to build a lightweight system where leads are manually added into a common intake pool, can be self-assigned or manually assigned, and are manually moved across predefined statuses. The system must be accessible from within or around the Gmail/Google Workspace periphery, using Workspace email as the only login and user identity. Key requirements include junior users self-assigning leads, senior users assigning leads to any user, and lead data storage for up to 30 days. Minimal/no-code solutions are preferred, with AppSheet as a consideration. Familiarity with Google Workspace is essential. Attached herewith is a detailed FRD to set the expectations clear

Est. Budget: $250.00

Milestone 1: Complete delivery as per discussed and share in FRD

Due: Thursday, Feb 5, 2026

Project funds: $250.00

[11:16 am, 23/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: My pleasure
[10:39 pm, 23/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Hi Rahul. It just occurred to me that we should also have the logic that if any query is deleted by any user (having the right to edit the record), the deletion should be approved by admin or pseudo admin before it disappears
[10:44 pm, 23/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Ok let me think about it
[10:51 pm, 23/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Ok. Thanks
[10:51 pm, 23/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Anything else? You would like to add?
[10:56 pm, 23/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Basically the users need to be pre defined
Junior CS users
Senior CS users

Right for above already covered in document

Below type of users — 1 each, need to have all rights as senior CS users + deletion approval right and direct deletion right

Pseudo Admin
Admin

A query edited by anyone should be ideally show a sign of ‘edited’ similar to how it shows ok whats app
[10:56 pm, 23/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Okay
[11:04 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Hi Rahul
[11:04 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Just checking on this
[11:23 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Yes implementing it as well
[11:25 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: If next the sign of edited— the first name of the user who last edited can appear if possible— or the name appears when one hovers over the edited sign— latter preferable — whatever best is possible
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Yes you can see the name. The hover part might not be possible as the design is too limited for addons
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Sure
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Possible to show Edited date and time also?
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Basically I realised
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Yes it's there
[11:26 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: That anyone can edit
[11:27 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: So better to have that visibility for accountability
[11:27 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Because while users cannot delete without admin approval
[11:28 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: But if they can edit we better have the visibility to ensure we know whose edited last and when
[11:28 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: only admin and psedo admins can approve the delete request or request directly. Right?
[11:28 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Correct
[11:28 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: I think these fields should fulfill our requirements
[11:29 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Yes looks good
[11:29 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Do we need to show who approved the delete request as well?
[11:29 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: No
[11:29 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Ok
[11:29 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: The two admins - pseudo admin and admin are me and my family member
[11:30 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: So since they only can approve deletion its fine
[11:30 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Also while I think I have tried marking fields should be mandatory to fill
[11:31 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: then it's good. What happens when we delete a query? Are we deleting it from the sheets or keeping it as deleted?
[11:33 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: While adding a new record into a say Bucket A- and/ or transferring status from one bucket to another, wherever applicable— I may want to see the final consolidated info sheet of mandatory and non mandatory fields — just to double check
[11:33 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Keep a record for deleted — but keep it visible only for upto 3 days from approved date/ time of deletion
[11:33 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Have you updated the FRD doc for it?
[11:34 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Got it.
[11:36 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Sure
[11:37 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: I'll get you first version to test with all the discussion we had till now, then we can iterate over it.
[11:37 am, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: Alright. Sounds good
[11:37 am, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Great
[12:55 pm, 24/1/2026] +91 98203 39908: One important aspect to keep in mind how do we keep the view for each user type: Aesthetic and easy to read and access considering the amount of data that would typically appear to them
[12:56 pm, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Yes, we've limited styling option so we've to think about it properly.
[1:03 pm, 24/1/2026] Rahul Gupta: Sure




/// DAY 30th jan chats 
This needs to be visible by default..after user clicks on the query description..currently its appearing after two clicks
Try hovering over the queries
ok..then why both
if the second is appearing audit trail let it visible
once user clicks and see the rectangular block
Sure
it should show there two..without second click
Ok
This should show numbers for total as well as each Status Bucket types with the corresponding colour and the title given to the bucket ( below it)
Ok
and for the senior users and admin, it should be total of all queries for all CS users including (self +  other senior users + pseudo admin + admin)
Will it be possible for them to see the breakdown of total users?
Or just the total numbers
Yes they can see,..would be good to include
Basically the sum of all users…only
including junior, senior, pseudo admin, admin
just total numbers
not their names
Ok
names of different users are visible to the people allocation and both admins
On hovered show 3 admins 
4 users... Something like this?
because they will choose the name to allocate
so only there
On hovered show 3 admins 
4 users... Something like this?
dont show that break up
Ok
Have you checked the assignment and reassignment?
names of different users are visible to the people allocation and both admins
that also only at the fields of picklist..where the users have to selected for allocation
Ok
however the audit trail can include any user name right
so the audit trail view will be same for all type of users
Yes
just that junior users can see on the queries assigned to them + all queries in bucket A
any user can add a query to bucket A
Yes try adding the query as well
Could you please open the sheets with developer account
any proposed deletion by any user type except both admin, requires approval for one of the admins
Okay
Could you please open the sheets with developer account
will try
How will this function
Sure open the sheet then in the"Users" sheet add more users
How will this function
It's not right now
will search and display from query description?
Yes i got it
We haven't discussed about it if we need it
but whats the plan for this
yes it important
good u suggested
Ok then we will add functionality as per your requirement
the word or words typed will search and show filtered results, by searching the match of the word or words from ‘all query descriptions’ visible or accessible to the user type..whichever is higher
when I try to see the user wise view
nothing is appearing
whatever I see, largely the structure looks good
except the above feedback
u seem to be on the right track
Sure let's iterate over it.
also there doesnt seem to be any latency and I hope that is how it stays when this app is completed and say has data of 200 queries
now only thing I am yet to check is the sheet right
It's running in live
lovable?
No
so if the speed is like this then we are good
Sure
I am happy with your work so far
well done
Thanks
developer id se login karu?
Please try to insert live queries with unique ids
developer id se login karu?
Sure
Usi se try kijiye
Usi id me sheet hai
ok
Sure sir
Let me know once the sheet is shared to access with raj@blackhattalent.com

Audit trail should include date and time too
Apart from name of the person and the action ( allocated by, added by, status changed by, edited by, deleted by ( only if applicable as very few queries would be deleted, the approver name for deletion need not appear)
Ok

I showed Smit this
[5:43 pm, 29/1/2026] +91 88794 16167: Hi @Rahul Gupta.. while I get back to you on the desired structure of the Google sheet, sharing below a point that we'd like to check on in the current functionality we've seen:

Sorting the records within buckets + visibility of date fields i.e. assigned date, proposal sent date etc. within the buckets: The use case/purpose of this is for the Senior users to be able to evaluate the records/queries that have been in assigned state for the longest and not moved to the next bucket of Proposal sent / Partially sent etc., along with getting to see the date that it was assigned on. Similar usage for the other buckets
[5:43 pm, 29/1/2026] +91 88794 16167: Also calling you to discuss a couple of other points pertaining to the current functioning of the app
